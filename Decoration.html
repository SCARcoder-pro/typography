        <code>observation,</code>
        experimentation, and the testing of <code>theories</code> against the evidence obtained.

    <h4>What is Photosynthesis?</h4>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p><mark>Photosynthesis</mark>, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms <mark>light
                energy</mark> into chemical
            energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon
            dioxide, and
            minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds.

    <h3>What is Universe?</h3>
    <pre>
            <p>The universe is everything. 
                It includes all of space, 
                and all the matter and energy that space contains. 
                It even
            includes time itself and, of course, it
             includes you. Earth and the Moon are part of the 
             universe, as are the other
            planets and their many dozens of moons.</p>
